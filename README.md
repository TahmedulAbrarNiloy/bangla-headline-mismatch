# bangla-headline-mismatch
This project aims to detect whether a Bangla news articleâ€™s headline accurately reflects its body content or is misleading. It is part of my capstone and research project under the supervision of Dr. Ahmedul Kabir.

## Objectives
- Build a labelled dataset of Bangla news headline-body pairs
- Train machine learning models to classify matched vs. mismatched articles
- Develop a web application to test headline-body pairs
- Integrate with a browser extension for automatic news scanning

## Project Timeline
Week 1 (Current):
- Set up repository
- Begin collecting dataset (30 headline-body samples)
- Train a baseline ML model
